# Canvas Studio API examples

In this repository, we collect example scripts that can be useful for the team and Studio account administrators to access the public API of Canvas Studio.

## Prerequisites

TBD

## Language

The scripts in this repository are prefered to be written in Python as it's widely adopted and easy to read.

## Layout of the repository

Each script needs to have its own subdirectory under the `examples` directory and needs to have a `README.md` explaining its purpose and how to use it.

i.e. if there's a script to download the captions of a media, the layout should look like:

```
examples/
    download-media-captions/
        script.py
        README.md
```
